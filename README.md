# Demonstration_Mesh-Generation (Work in Progress)
Playing with Mesh and Terrain Generation. The goal with this mini project is to understand and implement the Marching Cubes algorithm to efficiently create terrain.

# Mesh Generation
Successfully created a cube utilizing Cube data and procedural construction.

### To do
Would like to create more complex shapes.

# Terrain Generation
Using Perlin Noise and other cool maths (lacunarity, amplitude, octaves), create procedurally generated and interesting terrain. Write up in progress. :)

Here are some pictures of progress
